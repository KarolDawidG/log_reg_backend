For now we have:
1. The login panel that reads data from the MySQL database.
2. After logging in, you can choose the project you want to display.
3. Simple user registration panel.
4. A contact form that allows you to send an email from a website visitor.
5. A simple todo list, which is based on a MySql database. It allows to add tasks and display them, depending on which user is logged in.
6. More small projects will be available soon!
